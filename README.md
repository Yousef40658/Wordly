## ðŸ›  Approach
Initially, the game used an **online API** to fetch words.  
However:
- The API was limited to **1,000 words** without upgrading.
- It required an **active internet connection**.

To make the game **faster, more reliable, and fully offline**, the word lists were moved to local `.txt` files.  
Each `.txt` file contains **5,000 words** for the chosen difficulty level.  
This approach allows:
- **Unlimited gameplay** without relying on external services.
- Better **performance** in offline conditions.
- Easy difficulty selection in the GUI.

The GUI highlights each letter:
- **Green** if the letter is correct and in the correct position.
- **Yellow** if the letter exists but in a different position.
- **Gray** if the letter is not in the word.
